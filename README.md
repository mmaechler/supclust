supclust
========

`supclust` is an [R](https://www.r-project.org) package which has been on
CRAN since January 2004, see (https://cran.r-project.org/package=supclust).

It contains C and R code, written by Marcel Dettling in 2003, implementing
the WILMA and PELORA algorithms for
**sup**ervised **clust**ering of potentially many predictor variables,
notably for gene modeling.

Martin Maechler who had helped originally in getting the R package to CRAN
had taken maintenance in 2009, to prevent long term _orphaning_ of the package.

The source code has been moved to github only on Oct 15, 2020, using my own
`G2RCSn` utility and notably the
[rcs-fast-export.rb](https://github.com/Oblomov/rcs-fast-export) ruby script,
see also my
[blog post](https://mmaechler.blogspot.com/2014/08/how-i-got-175-years-old-github.html)
about how I achieved such a transformation for my
[sfsmisc](https://cran.r-project.org/package=supclust) CRAN R package.
